# Action Menus

## Usage

Action Menus are groups of buttons that include tasks (such as create, edit, and more) to the a list or content underneath. See [Grid Action Menus](http://127.0.0.1:5500/#/layouts-grid-with-filters-and-actions) for more info.

## Button Order

Actions should be arranged so that productive or non-destructive actions such as Add, Lock, Edit, etc. are first and destructive action such as Delete are last.

## Divider Lines

Use divider lines to separate action buttons into logical groups. Order the button actions as productive/non-destructive first, and destructive actions like Delete last.

## Combined with Filters

Filters (what you see) and an Action Menu (what you can do) make up a standard pattern in Bionic for things such as grids, heat maps, and other layouts.
