# Filters

Filters are available for many parts of Bionic applications and should follow the same model where possible.</p>

## Basics

- Clicking the filter menu should toggle between opening and closing the filter
- An apply button appears at the bottom so that you can select one or more options first
- Filters where there are a many choices should use a search field to narrow the list of options (approximately 10 or more)
- After you apply a filter, reopening the filter will show the currently selected values at the top, with non-selected values under those
- Use Google Sheets filtering as a model when questions of interaction arise
