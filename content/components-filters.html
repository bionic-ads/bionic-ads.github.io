## Basics

- Clicking the filter menu should toggle between opening and closing the filter
- Filter selections should persist for the user
- An apply button appears at the bottom so that you can select one or more options first
- Filters with many choices should use a search field to narrow the list of options (approximately 10 or more)
- After you apply a filter, reopening the filter will show the currently selected values at the top, with non-selected values under those
- Use Google Sheets filtering as a model when questions of interaction arise


## Accommodating Many Filters on the Same Page

- On screens that require many filters, use an optional control that allows selection of one or more filters
