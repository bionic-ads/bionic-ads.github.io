<h1>Filters</h1>
<p>Filters are available for many parts of Bionic applications and should follow the same model where possible.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clicking the filter menu should toggle between opening and closing the filter</li>
    <li>An apply button appears at the bottom so that you can select one or more options first</li>
    <li>Filters where there are a many choices should use a search field to narrow the list of options (approximately 10 or more)</li>
    <li>After you apply a filter, reopening the filter will show the currently selected values at the top, with non-selected values under those</li>
    <li>Use Google Sheets filtering as a model when questions of interaction arise</li>
</ul>
