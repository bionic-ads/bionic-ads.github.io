# Grid with Filters and Actions

## General Pattern

The basic approach for this layout is to combine three main components as the foundation for a range of features in the following order:

- [Filters](./#/components-filters) - what you see
- [Action Menu](./#/components-action-menus) - what you can do
- [Grid](./#/components-grids) - data you want to view or take action on

## Variations

### Excluding Filters and/or Actions

In some instances, the Filter row is not needed and can be excluded. Likewise, the Action Menu can also be excluded. In read-only cases that don't require filtering, you can exclude both.

### Put Filters and Actions on a Single Line

When there are a small set of filters and actions, optionally combine the Filters and Actions into a single line.
