# Grid with Filters and Actions

## General Pattern

The basic approach for this layout is to combine three main components as the foundation for a range of features:

- [Filters](./#/components-filters) - what data you see
- [Action Menus](./#/components-action-menus) - what you can do to that data
- [Grid](./#/components-grids) - data you want to view or take action on
