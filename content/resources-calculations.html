# Media Calculations

Requirements for media buying inputs and calculations in media plans

## Definitions

### Gross Media
The gross rate is the full cost of advertising and is the amount that advertisers historically pay for their ads to be aired (in radio advertising) or viewed (in television advertising). This includes a commission that is typically 15 percent of the cost of the total advertisement costs. In the case of radio stations, stations allow advertising agencies to take an agency commission for the payment, which recognizes the agency's working role in bringing an advertiser onto the airwaves. The gross rate can be calculated by dividing the net rate of advertising by .85. For examples, $10 net costs can be divided by .85 to become $11.76 gross costs. Today, the Gross Rate is like the sticker price on a new car. Nobody pays the gross rate in digital media. However, like the sticker price, it's often used as a reference to communicate "see how much you saved by buying through us!".

### Net Media
The net cost is the cost of an advertisement when there is no advertising agency involved, or the amount that a vendor expects to be paid after a 15 percent commission has been taken to an advertising agency. To calculate the net rate of advertising costs, multiply the gross rate by .85. For example, $10 gross rate multiplied by .85 becomes $8.50 net rate. This is like the invoice price on a new car - the price that the dealer pays the manufacturer for the inventory. The agency pays the vendor the net rate. Agency fees are added on top of that and can take many forms such as commissions, hourly charges, per placement fees, etc. (agencies are very creative in making money.

### Functional Currency
According to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), particularly Financial Accounting Statement No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation (FAS 52), and International Accounting Standards, particularly IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, every company should have one and only one Functional Currency, which is also known as a **Base Currency** or a **Home Currency**. All transactions in a company should be converted back to the Functional Currency.

### Transactional Currency
Organizations may enter into transactions (orders, invoices, payments, etc.) in currencies other than the Functional Currency. The currency of each transaction is called the Transactional Currency.

### Reporting Currency
Organizations may report (spending over time, spending by channel, etc.) in currencies other than the Functional Currency. The transactions that are represented in the reports may have been conducted in many different Transaction Currencies. However, all have been converted back to the Functional Currency. According to the accounting standards mentioned above, it's not necessary to convert each Transaction Currency into every currency you'd ever wish to report on because it would be an absolute nightmare. Instead, they advise us to use current exchange rates, regardless of the underlying Transaction Dates, to convert from the Functional Currency of each transaction to the Reporting Currency of the report. This means that all reports should be run in the Functional Currency and then converted to the Reporting Currency at the last minute at the current rates.
