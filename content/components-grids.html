# Grids

## Layout

![Grid](images/content/components/grid.png)

### Column Widths

Bionic grids have two primary column width options, Fixed Width and Evenly Spaced.

#### Fixed-Width (Default)

Fixed-width grid layouts should use a fluid final column when there are only a handful of columns. 

EXAMPLE: Picklist Admin, Campaign List

#### Evenly Spaced

Evenly spaced columns are a useful option when columns make sense to be the same size. This is useful for data visualizations such as a Usage Report heatmap.

EXAMPLE: Usage Report

### Grid Line Colors

Primary grid lines (headers and vertical dividing lines) should be 1px solid #dddddd; 
In Sass, the color is defined as a variable called #grid-primary-border-color

Secondary grid lines (main body lines) should be 1px solid #eeeeee; 
In Sass, the color is defined as a variable called #grid-secondary-border-color

------

### Fixed First Column

The first column (after the line numbers) should have a border on the right so that the border is visible on scroll

------

### Summary Rows

Should appear outside the grid and use bold text formatting in most cases

------

### Row Height

The height of the grid rows (headers and main content) should be 40px

## Filtering

Any filtering of a grid should persist at the user level. See [Filters](#/components-filters) for more information.

## Checkboxes

All multiple selection of rows using Shift+Click

## Actions

## Scrolling

## Sorting

### Remember Sort Order
Remember the User's Last Sort for Each Page

### Include Sorting Icons Where Applicable
Allow sorting for icon columns:
e.g., Following, Locked, Active 

### Names
Sort the names of people using First Name instead of Last Name (presuming the first name is what's shown first)
