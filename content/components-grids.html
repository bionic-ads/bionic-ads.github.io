# Grids

## Layout

![Grid](images/content/components/grid.png)

### Grid Line Colors

Primary grid lines (headers and vertical dividing lines) should be 1px solid #dddddd; 
In Sass, the color is defined as a variable called #grid-primary-border-color

Secondary grid lines (main body lines) should be 1px solid #eeeeee; 
In Sass, the color is defined as a variable called #grid-secondary-border-color

### Fixed First Column

The first column (after the line numbers) should have a border on the right so that the border is visible on scroll

### Summary Rows

Should appear outside the grid and use bold text formatting in most cases

### Row Height

The height of the grid rows (headers and main content) should be 40px

## Filtering

Any filtering of a grid should persist at the user level. See [Filters](#/components-filters) for more information.

## Checkboxes

All multiple selection of rows using Shift+Click

## Actions

## Sorting

### Remember Sort Order
Remember the User's Last Sort for Each Page

### Names
Sort the names of people using First Name instead of Last Name (presuming the first name is what's shown first)
