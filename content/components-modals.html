# Modals

## Confirmation Dialogs

### Title

The title of a modal should be the action or question to be performed

### Body

The text in the middle of the confirmation modal should add additional detail. Ideally this should **not** be a complete repeat of the title.

### Buttons

Button labels should reflect the action being taken as much as possible
