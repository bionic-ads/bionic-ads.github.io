## Color
### **Do Not** Use Color for Critical Information

Color is used primarily as a secondary indicator to supplement and enhance information. In most instances, rely on symbols or icons that still make sense even if the color is removed.

**Example:** use a warning icon from font awesome, then make it red (instead of using color as the only indicator)


### Color Blindness

The Color palette we use for row background colors needs work to provide enough difference for color-blind users.

## Text Sizes

Bionic Planner generally scales in the browser well but ultimately needs testing to ensure it's accessible and useable when the font size is increased.
