# Tooltips

## Delay

Tooltips should have a slight delay (500ms) to prevent many tooltips firing as the user's cursor moves around the screen.

## Formatting

Tooltips should use title case capitalization:  
**This Is the Text of a Tooltip (Notice the Appropriate Words Are Capitalized)**

## Links to Help Documentation

Where appropriate, tooltips should have a link to more information in the Help documentation
