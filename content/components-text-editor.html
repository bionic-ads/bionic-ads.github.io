# Text Editor

## Froala 

- [http://froala.com](http://froala.com)
- Uses Font Awesome icons out of the box, so it matches Bionic with minimal effort

## Default Froala Menu Configuration

The goal is to allow people to work within the Bionic style, so many nifty Froala tools are disabled. The following set of menu items should be provided as defaults:

- Header/Paragraph
- Bold
- Italic
- Alignment
- Numbered List
- Bulleted List
- Reduce Indent
- Increase Indent
- Insert Link
- Undo
- Redo
- Show Code (for development purposes only - should be removed for production)
