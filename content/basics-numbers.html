# Numbers & Currency

Formatting of numbers and currency is especially important for Bionic applications. Media Plans are all about the numbers: how much does a placement cost? how many impressions do you want to serve? what is the Net media rate for a placement.

## Numbers

    Use commas for numbers over 999

<span class="bdg-numbers">99,999,999</span>

## Currency

Separate currency values from currency symbols with a space
    
<span class="bdg-numbers"><span class="bdg-currency-symbol">$</span> 123,999.00</span>
    
Currency symbol should be in medium gray
    
## Alignment

Align numbers to the **right** when they are displayed in a tabular format

Align currency symbols to the left (accounting formatting)
