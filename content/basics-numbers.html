# Numbers & Currency

Formatting of numbers and currency is especially important for Bionic applications. Media Plans are all about the numbers: how much does a placement cost? how many impressions do you want to serve? what is the Net media rate for a placement.

## Numbers

Use commas for numbers over 999

<span class="bdg-numbers">99,999,999</span>

## Number Alignment

When displayed in tables, numbers that represent an amount of something should be aligned to the **right**

**NOTE:** Numbers that are IDs (e.g., Bionic ID) are not amounts and should align **left**

## Currency

### Long Format

Example: CAD - Canadian Dollar

### Short Format

Example: CAD

### Currency Symbols

Separate currency values from currency symbols with a space
    
<span class="bdg-numbers"><span class="bdg-currency-symbol">$</span> 123,999.00</span>
    
Currency symbol should be in medium gray
    
## Currency Alignment in Tables / Grids

Align numbers to the **right** when they are displayed in a tabular format
AND
Align currency symbols to the left (accounting formatting)
