## Differences between Dropdowns and Comboboxes

Note that the difference between Dropdowns and Comboboxes is that custom text **cannot** be entered in a dropdown

A Combobox, however, can be either one of the choices in the menu or custom text from the user (making it a hybrid of a dropdown and input box)

Note the styling difference: a Combobox has a line to the left of the down arrow; a dropdown has purely a down arrow with no line to the left. The divider line means that the left part is an input field that can accept custom text, and the down arrow on the right side is a menu.
