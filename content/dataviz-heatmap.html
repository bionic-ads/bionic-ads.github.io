## Usage

The heatmap chart is used for the user report to visualize activity in the application at a glance. Create a heatmap by combining a grid control with varying background colors in grid cells. The general approach is to use a single color and use varying degrees of opacity to represent values. The highest values in the table have a background opacity of 100%.

## Specifications

- Based on the [Grid component](#/components-grids)
- Use descending degrees of opacity to highlight areas
- Numbers should be aligned right
