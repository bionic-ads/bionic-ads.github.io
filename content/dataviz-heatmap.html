# Heat Map

![Heatmap](images/content/data-viz/heatmap.png)

## Usage

The heatmap chart is used for the user report to visualize activity in the application at a glance. Create a heatmap by combining a grid control with varying background colors in grid cells. The general approach is to use a single color and use varying degrees of opacity to represent values. The highest values in the table have a background opacity of 100%.

## Specifications

- Use descending degrees of opacity to highlight areas
- Divide values into buckets of 20%:
    - 100 - 81%
    - 80 - 61%
    - 60 - 41%
    - 40 - 21%
    - 20 - 0%
    

- Numbers should be aligned right

## Implementation

- Custom implementation of the [Grid component](#/components-grids)
